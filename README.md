# MetaMic
This is the main *MetaMic* WebXR front-end

*MetaMic* is a cross-disciplinary research project involving expertise in the fields of architectural history and design, computer design and computer science. It aims to innovate digital tools for the enhancement of cultural heritage, in order to make them usable by all kinds of possible users: school students of all levels, university students, specialist scholars, as well as tourists and the merely curious. It takes Michelangelo Buonarroti's unrealised architecture as a case study, but proposes itself as a pilot-experience that can be extended to other objects of a cultural nature. MetaMic intends to apply to a digital framework dedicated to cultural content, some communicative and IT characteristics of the current metaverses: immersiveness in a 3D environment, augmented reality, interactivity, participativeness and FAIR principles.
